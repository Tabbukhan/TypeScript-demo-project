# .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Name of your workflow
name: Node.js CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ] # Runs on pushes to the main branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ] # Runs on pull requests targeting the main branch

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This job is named "build-and-test"
  build-and-test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code (similar to Source Code Checkout in Bamboo)
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Setup Node.js environment (similar to setting up an executable in Bamboo)
      - name: Use Node.js 18.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18.x'
          cache: 'npm' # Caches npm packages for faster subsequent runs

      # Step 3: Install dependencies (similar to a Script task in Bamboo)
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci # 'ci' is generally faster and more reliable for CI environments than 'install'

      # Step 4: Build the project (a Script task in Bamboo)
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      # Step 5: Run tests (a Script task in Bamboo)
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test
        
      # Step 6: Run linter (a Script task in Bamboo)
      - name: Lint code
        run: npm run lint
